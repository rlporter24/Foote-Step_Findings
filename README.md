# Foote-Step Findings
## This is a repository for experimental procedures, set ups, & findings based on repetition of Eunice Newton Foote's early work uncovering what we now know as the 'Greenhouse Gas Effect'. 

In 1856, an American scientist named Eunice Newton Foote conducted a seminal experiment, uncovering what we now call the 'Greenhouse gas effect' of carbon dioxide. Her initial publication in the *American Assosciation for the Advancement of Science* can be found [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a2614102278e77e59a04f26/t/5aa1c3cf419202b500c3b388/1520550865302/foote_circumstances-affecting-heat-suns-rays_1856.pdf), and an article from the Washington Post describing her work and providing historical context can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/11/17/eunice-newton-foote-john-tyndall/). This pioneering experiment can be easily replicated at home or in the classroom to observe the 'Greenhouse gas effect' firsthand. A full experimental guide, example data, and example analyses can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jG9SnJfxXYrRZ0pTnO3tU6W8_VhzS1oJ?usp=sharing).
